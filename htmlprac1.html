    <h2>HTML이란 무엇인가?</h2>
    <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html4/">Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</a> is the standard markup language
    <strong> for creating we pages </strong> and <u>web</u> applications.
    <p style="margin-top:40px;"> Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local
    storage and render them into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the
    structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for
    the appearance of the document. HTML elements are the building blocks of
    HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects, such as
    interactive forms, may be embedded into the rendered page. It provides
    a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics
    for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items.
        HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. </p>
